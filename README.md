# Placeholder for our first permissively licensed JavaScript project to re-license with OS.Cash.

OS.Cash Licensing can work for client side JavaScript libraries, server side JavaScript libraries, JavaScript frameworks, and even tooling that's used to process and work with JavaScript.

If you're a JavaScript developer leveraging the flexibility of a permissive license like MIT for your software, consider the advantages of transitioning to the OS.Cash License.

OS.Cash License introduces a sustainable model that supports both the growth of your project and the broader open-source community. For projects ranging from front-end frameworks and web-based tools to back-end libraries and desktop applications with Electron, the OS.Cash License protects your interests while fostering a fair use ecosystem and ensuring that Billion Dollar Businesses contribute financially to your product.
 
Traditional permissive licenses that allow large corporations to use your software without contributing back, the OS.Cash License ensures that Billion Dollar Businesses contribute financially to your project. This approach not only bolsters your project's financial sustainability but also encourages responsible and equitable relationships between developers and industry.
